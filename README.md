# PyCrawler++
## Made by Jake La Raia and Henry Cussatt for CS2300
PyCrawler++ is a C++ based dungeon crawling game with randomly generated dungeons to explore, turn-based combat, and an upgrade system! After running the Python built map generation tool, you are given 3 different levels to explore, all with randomized layouts of rooms! 

## Modules and Concepts from CS2300
Concepts were used and applied from all four modules, including:

State-based programming from module 4, allowing for dynamic player input. This also uses concepts from module 1, having precise input validation, allowing the user to reattempt incorrect inputs with no risk of bugging/proceeding the program in an unintended way.

Is-A relationships from module 2, allowing for a general Enemy object to be differentiated into three different types, a Goblin, an Orc, and a Dragon. Each enemy has different stats, and therefore has different constructors. However the individual stats can be reached in the same way, making the Is-A relationship fitting. 

## Operating System Required
This project was tested on both Windows and Mac machines, and should work on either. Mac has been more thoroughly tested, however.
No added installations are necessary.

|---|---|---|---|
|Concepts: Is-A or Has-A class relationship|No such C++ class relationship present in the program|Class relationship is trivial, poorly designed, and/or poorly implemented|Class relationship is designed well, implemented robustly, and used in the main program in a way that makes sense|
